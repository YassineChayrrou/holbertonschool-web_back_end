# 0x07. Session authentication

In this project, we will implement a Session Authentication from scratch without the use of other modules to implement it.

Note: in industry we use modules and/or frameworks to implement session authentication systems because of security reasons and production time as it is easier to use already developed and maintained system then loosing time making you own!
